This Github Repository contains experiments on Knowledge Distillation in comparison to a fine-tuned model on the task of image-text matching.

# Dataset
The dataset used is a manipulation of MsCOCO captions, that gives a set of matching and mismatching image-caption pairs. The dataset is balanced and can be used for binary image-text matching classification.

In order to get access to the dataset you just need to run the file inside ```.\code\``` with this command:

```python3 create_dataset.py ```

# Experiments 
The folder ```.\code\``` contains four Jupyter notebooks using the aforementioned dataset.

```Data exploration ``` is just a notebook with some plots that gives information on how the data looks.
